A c# code made for and Visual Studio console app

Purpose:

A personalized to do list that allows events to be input with a due date, an amount of time to complete, its importance out of 10, a uniquie title, and a description
These events can be sorted by three different factors: time to complete, due date, and most important.
All of this is done in the console, using number inputs to navigate the screens.
The main screen has a save option that will save your events in a text file in the project folder

How to set up:

Add a path to the location you would like the text file to be, I would recommend making this in the same spot you are storing the code file.
Can can find the location to store this path in the ProjectManagement namspace at the top of the EventManager class.
end the path with \ProjectManagerSaveText.txt

Notes:

I really dont care who uses this code or not, if you want to use it, copy it, or do whatever with it, I don't care. Just dont take credit (not that you'd really want to, its probably relativly messy)
If you use it and run into problems, please tell me so I can fix them, same with any suggestions.
